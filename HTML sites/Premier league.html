	<p id="rcorners1">The best goal of the week goes to Romelu Lukaku with an an amazing left footed shot from a freekick going into top corner, leaving Mandanda in his place!</p>

	<section><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hfA9BMFjPwM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></section>
	<p id="rcorners1"> Good run by Nemanja MatiÄ‡ that ended with a shot that was blocked by the defender, with some luck it bounced off to Diego Costa would had nothing to do but put it top right corner.</p>
	<br></br>

	<p class="h2"> GOTW #3 </p>
	<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c7MOaygwQgU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p id="rcorners1"> Amazing control by Xherdan Shaqiri who stops it, brings it forward, fakes, and takes a wack at the ball placing it precisely in the top right corner.</p>

	<p class="h2"> GOTW #4 </p>

	<p id="rcorners1"> Eden Hazard named premier league player of the month! It was deserved, the 25-year-old scored three goals and created another as he brings the Blues back into the title frame with four successive victories. </p>
<!-- Fourth goal of the week, links directly to youtube video. Plus it has a text box -->
	
	<p class="h2"> Save of the Week </p>
	<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EccZFtgd9eU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
	<p id="rcorners1"> This is not a goal of the week, but instead it's the save of the week. Amazing performance by Tom Heaton against Manchester United,
	who saved a well executed shot King Zlatan, by jumping straight infront of the shot. </p>
