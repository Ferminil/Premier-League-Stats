	<p id="rcorners1"> Huge fail by italian goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon, who comes out of his net to get the ball but completely misses it!</p>
	<!-- First fail, similar to BGOTW layout -->

	<p id="rcorners1"> First of all, this has to be staged like what kind of goalie with almost no pressure on decides to just do that PLUS the other player
	is literally infront of the net you don't even have to shoot you just need to place it like what?</p>
	<!-- second fail, similar to BGOTW layout -->
