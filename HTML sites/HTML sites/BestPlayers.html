	<p id="rcorners1"> Musa is the perfect striker to start a bpl team! He's fast has a fairly good shot and is overpowered. For 2k you should for sure try him.  </p>

	<p id="rcorners1"> You should get this all round amazing midfielder. He's strong, nice shot, and nice passing. He's a high/high
	which enables him to be anywhere on the field. </p>
