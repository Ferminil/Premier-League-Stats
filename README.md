# Premier-League-Stats
Everything about the Premier League

My name is Luca and this is my website about Premiere league stats. It includes many things such as videos of fails and best goals in the soccer world. It also includes pictures of the current soccer game on consoles and PC, FIFA 17. There is a sign up page where you can sign up and catch the latest news of my website.

In this website I am trying to achieve a website that has many different subtopics for soccer fans around the world. I would like to make the sign up page work and I would like to give the selection of every single country in the world. I want to add some rating system or commenting system for the goals and fails of the week. I would like to make the Quiz page function and give results on how you did.
